### Hi there 🤓

My name is Olya, and I am a Junior Data Analyst from Russia. 
I am planning to move to Georgia in Fall 2023. 

About me:
🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Finance and a Master's degree in Management.</br>
👩🏻‍💻 I have gained work experience at various levels of business, from working in a warehouse to conducting business negotiations.</br>
📖 I completed data analytics courses in August 2023 and continue to deepen my knowledge in this field by taking various free courses.</br>
🕵🏻‍♀️ I am naturally curious and always ask "Why is this so?" in different areas of my life.</br>
🐕‍🦺 In my free time, I enjoy training my dog and reading popular science literature.</br>

My hard skills include SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), statistical analysis, data visualization (Tableau, PowerBI), and basic business knowledge. 
My soft skills include teamwork, ability to learn, creativity, adaptability, critical thinking, independence, and customer orientation.

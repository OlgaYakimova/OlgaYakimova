### Hi there ðŸ¤“

I'm Olya, Junior Data Analyst from Russia, planning to move to Georgia in Fall 2024. 

A year ago, I made the decision to transition into the IT field because everything related to it fascinates me. Writing code is like magic to me, and seeing the output results is real wizardry. After exploring various areas in IT, I realized that I wanted to become a data analyst. I love learning new things, have a critical thinking mindset, and always look for unconventional solutions. Thanks to my education and experience, I am confident that I can successfully start working in this new field.

My hard skills include SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), statistical analysis, data visualization (Tableau, PowerBI), and basic business knowledge. 
My soft skills include teamwork, ability to learn, creativity, adaptability, critical thinking, independence, and customer orientation.

My hobbies include dog training (kinology), reading popular science literature, and searching for answers to the question "why is a human the way he is?" From evolutionary theory and neurobiology to psychology, history, and even astrology.
